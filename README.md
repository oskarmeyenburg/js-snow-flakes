# JS Snow Flakes
**JS Snow Flakes** is a script that can be inserted into an HTML header to add a snowfall effect to a website. You can customize the appearance of the snowflakes by adjusting some variables.
<br><br>

## Integration
To integrate the script into your HTML file, copy and paste one of the following tags into a HTML-header:<br>
JavaScript-version:
<br>
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oskarmeyenburg/SnowFlakesJs@main/snowflakes.min.js"></script>
```
<br>
Or the CSS-version:<br><br>

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oskarmeyenburg/SnowFlakesJs@main/snowflakes_css.min.js"></script>
```
<br>

If you prefer to modify the variables, add another script tag containing your adjustments. Refer to the list of available variables below for customization options.
Here is an example for the usage with adjustments to SNOWFLAKE_SPEED and SNOWFLAKE_NUMBER.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oskarmeyenburg/SnowFlakesJs@main/snowflakes.min.js"></script>
<script>
    SNOWFLAKE_SPEED = 0.5;
    SNOWFLAKE_NUMBER = 30;
</script>
```
<br>

In case you encounter performance issues, consider using an alternative version that uses CSS for animations. You might also prefer to use it, as it is less subsceptible to bugs. Include the script as follows:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oskarmeyenburg/SnowFlakesJs@main/snowflakes_css.min.js"></script>
```
<br>

Feel free to experiment with other variables to achieve the desired visual effect on your website!

### SNOWFLAKE_SPEED
Determine the average downward velocity for each snowflake.
<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_SPEED = 1;``

### SNOWFLAKE_SPEED_DIVERGENCE
Specify the range for the speed of the snowflakes as a divergence.
<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_SPEED_DIVERGENCE = 3;``

### SNOWFLAKE_MIN_SIZE and SNOWFLAKE_MAX_SIZE
Set the range of random sizes in pixels for each snowflake.
<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_MIN_SIZE = 5;``<br>``SNOWFLAKE_MAX_SIZE = 15;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_ROTATION_SPEED

<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_ROTATION_SPEED = 25;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_NUMBER
Set the total count of snowflakes spawned at the beginning.
<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_NUMBER = 15;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_CENTER_REDUCTION
Reduce the spawning of snowflakes in the center of the screen.
<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_CENTER_REDUCTION = true;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_COLORS

<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_SHADOW = true;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_SHADOW_COLOR

<br>Default:<br>``SNOWFLAKE_SHADOW_COLOR = #000000;``<br>

### SNOWFLAKE_SPAWN_ON_SCREEN
